Flash Test Environment with Production
Prerequisites
 Check that it is okay to overwrite Test (Sometimes your site may have things in progress and don’t want to lose the current test instance so a new ‘test’ instance needs to be made)
Database Backup/Restore
 Create backup of the MAGIQ Performance MSSQL test database for DR purpose.
 Take a backup of the MAGIQ Performance MSSQL production database.
 Restore the production backup over the top of the test database.
Post Restore MSSQL
There are various hard coded path locations in the database. You will need to run SQL to fix them in the test environment.
The following is SQL Server specific and the path references will obviously be relevant to the site you are working on. We recommend running a SELECT statement on the tables to identify the original data to start:
-- CT_ATTACHMENTS
UPDATE CT_ATTACHMENTS SET FILEPATH = REPLACE(FILEPATH, '\\<server>\MAGIQ\PROD', '\\<server>\MAGIQ\TEST ');
-- CT_EI_ALERTS
UPDATE CT_EI_ALERTS
SET SUMMARY_RESULT_HTML = REPLACE(CAST(SUMMARY_RESULT_HTML AS VARCHAR(8000)), '\\<server>\MAGIQ\PROD', '\\<server>\MAGIQ\TEST '); UPDATE CT_EI_ALERTS
SET SUMMARY_RESULT_HTML_HIGH = REPLACE(CAST(SUMMARY_RESULT_HTML_HIGH AS VARCHAR(8000)), '\\<server>\MAGIQ\PROD', '\\<server>\MAGIQ\TEST '); UPDATE CT_EI_ALERTS
SET SUMMARY_RESULT_HTML_LOW = REPLACE(CAST(SUMMARY_RESULT_HTML_LOW AS VARCHAR(8000)), '\\<server>\MAGIQ\PROD', '\\<server>\MAGIQ\TEST ');
-- CT_EI_PORTLETS
UPDATE CT_EI_PORTLETS SET PORTLET_DETAILS = REPLACE(PORTLET_DETAILS, '\\<server>\MAGIQ\PROD', '\\<server>\MAGIQ\TEST ');
-- CT_EI_FUN_PARAMS
UPDATE CT_EI_FUN_PARAMS SET PARAMETER_VALUE = REPLACE(PARAMETER_VALUE, '\\<PROD SERVER>', '\\<TEST SERVER>')
Application
The application itself is stored as files on the designated Application Server. Users access it via a Windows share which in turn downloads the app to the local PC.
To set up a copy to the test environment, copy the 'production' application files to the 'test' location and set up a 'test' share:
 Create copy of the test bin directory (..\software\bin) for DR purpose.
 Locate production bin directory (..\software\bin) and copy all files EXCEPT for files with a .XML
extension ( e.g. but not limited to “CT.EI.Configurations.xml” & “CT.EI.ConfigurationsTool.xml” )
 Paste files into test bin directory
 Open CT.EI.Config.exe and check configuration. This will require a password owned by MAGIQ.
 DO NOT PUBLISH TEST ENVIRONMENTS as this may conflict with production environments if on the
same server.
 Set up a Windows share for accessing the test environment.
MAGIQGenerator(s) – For initial set up only
Please note this section assumes that the MAGIQ consultant set up the connection settings within the generator with both environments.
 Locate any .PGF files in use:
 Create copy of files from test for DR purpose.
 Copy production PGF files over the top of test files.
 Then open the MAGIQGenerator software and edit
 Open MAGIQGenerator tabs
 Press “F4”
 Change MAGIQGenerator settings to the test location instead of production
 Open parameters and ensure that any source documents are referenced to the test server.
Configurations Directory
 Open configurations (..\configurations) and then config (e.g. MAGIQ or PROD) directory - Create copies of the files within the directory for DR purpose.
 Copy all files from the production directory into test.
Other
 Any portlets with UNC paths to test need to be reconfigured to the test server
 Any Splash Alerts (using the HTML with images in them) will need to be reconfigured to the test
server.
